# WIkiScraper
### A program that tries to get the infobox of Wikipedia pages (If it has one) and display it nicely.  
## DO NOT SPAM WIKIPEDIA WITH REQUESTS FROM GENERATED BY THIS PROGRAM    
If you would like to test things with this program, it is a better idea  
to just pass in the HTML as the source, instead of sending requests to 
a page just for testing. Also do not look up the same thing twice within  
a time period of atleast 10 minutes.
